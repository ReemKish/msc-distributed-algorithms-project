      How to use the program
      ──────────────────────
	1. Run Sinalgo and choose `centralized_computing` from the
	   Available Projects list.
	2. Click `Build Tree` and input the number of leaves and max fanout as prompted.
	3. A tree will be built. Now, in Simulation Control open the drop down menu near
	   The Run button and choose "Run Specified # of Rounds".
	4. Set `Rounds to do` and `Refresh rate` to 1.
	5. Now, with each click of the Run button, a single round will be simulated.
	
	In less then 10 rounds the algorithm will terminate and the maximal independent set will
	be visible (all orange nodes).
	Note that the first few rounds are the coloring stage, in which the nodes of the tree visibly change
	colors iteratively until a 6-coloring is achieved. Then, the coloring is used to find a MIS according
	to the algorithms shown in class.
